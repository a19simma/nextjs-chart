          My name is Simon and I am a newly graduated software developer with a
          BSc in Computer Science from the University of Sk√∂vde, Sweden. For the
          thesis, me and two fellow students explored the effects on
          hyperparameter optimization on an agent in vizdoom (a doom Machine
          Learning library) using a framework called optuna. More of my projects
          can be found on github and maybe above as live demos.

          During freetime I enjoy reading fiction books like Earthsea Cycle,
          Dune, Wheel of Time and anything by Brandon Sanderson. I love
          simulation games like Factorio, Satisfactory and Oxygen not Included
          for solo and League of Legends or Age of Empire when playing with
          friends.
